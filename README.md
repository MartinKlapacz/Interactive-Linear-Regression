# Interactive linear regression: 
Each click on the left window will create a new point.
If there are at least two points, a regression curve will appear and
will take the existing points into consideration.
Each new point will update the curve.
Both graphs on the right coordiante system display the squared and absolute
regression error.
By clicking on the CLEAR-Button, the window will be resetted.
